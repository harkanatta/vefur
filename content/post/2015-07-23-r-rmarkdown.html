<h1>R Markdown</h1>
<p>This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" class="uri">http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com</a>.</p>
<p>You can embed an R code chunk like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(networkD3)
URL &lt;- paste0(&#39;https://cdn.rawgit.com/christophergandrud/networkD3/&#39;,
              &#39;master/JSONdata/energy.json&#39;)
energy &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(URL)

# Plot
sankeyNetwork(Links = energy$links, Nodes = energy$nodes, Source = &#39;source&#39;,
             Target = &#39;target&#39;, Value = &#39;value&#39;, NodeID = &#39;name&#39;,
             units = &#39;TWh&#39;, fontSize = 12, nodeWidth = 30)</code></pre>
